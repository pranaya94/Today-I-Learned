# TODO
1. Go through https://javascript.info/ and JS stuff I might not already know.

## Small stuff
* special numeric types infinity,-infinity,NaN
* typeof null as object is a known js bug
* let n = Number("8"); let n = +"8"; let ch = String(8)
* a = b = c = 3; assignemnt operator returns value of assigned variable
* comma operator
```js
let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4)
alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
```
* let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100); //default input value 100
* let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?"); // OK or CANCEL
* || operator evaluates from left to rigth and RETURNS first truthy value encountered or the last operand value of false.
```js
let currentUser = null;
let defaultUser = "John";
let name = currentUser || defaultUser || "unnamed";
alert( name ); // selects "John" â€“ the first truthy value
```
```js
alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
```
* & operator evaluates left to right and RETURNS first falsy value or the last operand value if all true.
* The directive continue helps to decrease nesting level

## Good stuff
* In JS object names are references to a memory loacation ie objects are assigned by reference.
  ```let a = { name : "pran" }; let b = a; b.name = "aya"; console.log(a.name)```
  
  **CLONING**
  
  To make a copy of object use ```js let newObj = Object.assign(destObj,srcObc1,srcObj2,srcObj3)``` will copy the properties of srcObj's to destObj and return the destObj.
  Eg. to clone an object 'User', ```let cloneUser = Object.assign({},User)```
  
  **DEEP CLONING**
  
  If source object has properties of type Object eg ```let person = { name : "pranaya", address : { street : "a", flat : "b" }}``` then the property ```street``` will copied as a reference. To solve this we will need to check if prop of source object is of type Object and then use Object.assign for it. **OR** use ```lodash``` library function called ```_.cloneDeep(obj).```
  
* Garbage collection
2. Do first 15 excercies of https://github.com/chris-void/pyway/blob/master/Learn%20Python%20The%20Hard%20Way%2C%203rd%20Edition%20.pdf
3. Make changes to SC**T API
4. Go through React Native docs
