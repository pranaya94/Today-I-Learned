# PM2

* Ports > 1024 are privi ports and you need root access to run you server there
* If you need to run the server on port 80 you should use a reverse proxy like nginx that will run using a system account on a privileged port and proxy the requests to your Node.js server running on an unprivileged port (> 1024).
* give node processes access to this port by ```sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which node` ```
